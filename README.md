Bluetooth module can be replaced by USB-Bluetooth adapter. The best
amplifier will be PAM8403(choose this based on size to performance ratio)
other TDA chips can also be used. Speakers should of lower specs of about 3W
connected with left and right terminal of amplifier output , either it can be of
4Ω or 8Ω based on availability. This project can be completely done with the
trash as most of the components were salvaged from electronic junk and I
recommend to use old junk instead of new components .
If you need help in salvaging components feel free to ask in comment section
